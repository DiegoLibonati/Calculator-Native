# Calculator Native

## Educational Purpose

This project was created primarily for **educational and learning purposes**.  
While it is well-structured and could technically be used in production, it is **not intended for commercialization**.  
The main goal is to explore and demonstrate best practices, patterns, and technologies in software development.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository on your computer using: `git clone URL`.
2. Go to the APP directory.
3. Execute: `yarn install` or `npm install`
4. Execute: `yarn run start` or `npm run start` and select the desired option!

- If you don't have expo and an Android simulator installed, search for a tutorial on YouTube.

## Description

This application is made with react native. It is a calculator that allows to:

1. Change the theme from light to dark
2. Add
3. Subtract
4. Multiply
5. Divide
6. Change from positive to negative and vice versa
7. Return to 0
8. Get the percentage

It is my first native application. The first of hopefully many :D
